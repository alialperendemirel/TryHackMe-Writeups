Diving deeper into Reverse Engineering! 🚀

Just completed the "Compiled" room on TryHackMe! 💻

This challenge was a great refresher on the fundamentals of Reverse Engineering and file analysis. It reminded me that in cybersecurity, you should never trust a file extension.

My key takeaways from this challenge:
🔹 File Identity: Extensions can be deceiving. Always verify the file type using "Magic Bytes" (using the 'file' command).
🔹 Static Analysis: Tools like 'strings' are powerful for quickly extracting ASCII data and hardcoded credentials from binaries.
🔹 Decompilation: Understanding how to reverse the compilation process (turning binary back into source code) is essential for analyzing malware or solving CTFs.

It's fascinating to see how high-level code translates into machine instructions and how we can reverse that process. On to the next challenge! 🔥
